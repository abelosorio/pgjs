# Introduction

## What is pgjs?

pgjs is **THE ORM for PostgreSQL**, specifically designed for modern JavaScript projects. Unlike generic ORMs that try to support multiple databases, pgjs is built from the ground up for PostgreSQL, embracing all of its powerful features.

## Why pgjs?

PostgreSQL is a powerful database with unique features like:
- `WINDOW` functions
- `MATERIALIZED VIEWS`
- `LATERAL` joins
- `GIN` indexes
- `JSONB` operations

Most ORMs either don't support these features or make them difficult to use. pgjs changes that by providing first-class support for everything PostgreSQL has to offer.

### Why Not Other ORMs?

While other ORMs like Sequelize are popular, they come with significant drawbacks:

- **Generic Approach**: Most ORMs try to support multiple databases, missing out on PostgreSQL's best features
- **Bloat**: Many ORMs are hard to tree-shake and introduce unnecessary complexity
- **Verbose APIs**: Query builders often make SQL feel harder than it should be

## Our Philosophy

pgjs is built on four core principles:

1. **PostgreSQL-First**
   - Not just "compatible with" PostgreSQL
   - Built specifically for PostgreSQL
   - Leverages all PostgreSQL features

2. **Clean, Simple API**
   - Fluent interface that feels natural
   - Outputs real PostgreSQL
   - No unnecessary abstractions

3. **Extensibility**
   - Support for raw SQL
   - Full JSONB operations
   - Triggers and views
   - Anything PostgreSQL can do

4. **No Magic**
   - No weird models
   - No hidden complexity
   - Just you and your database
